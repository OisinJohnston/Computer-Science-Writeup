According to Mayo Clinic men need to consume around 3.7L of water in a day and women need to consume roughly 2.7L. [ref](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256)

There are roughly 25cl of water in a standard glass.

Therefore men need too consume roughly $`5\frac{5}{12}`$ glasses of water in a day and women need to consume $`11\frac{1}{4}`$
